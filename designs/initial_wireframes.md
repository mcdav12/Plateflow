Here is the complete list of all the wireframes we've designed for the **PlateFlow** MVP, organized by their respective user flows.

### **1. Magic Meal User Flow**

* **Home Screen Wireframe**: The central entry point for all users, featuring the "Magic Meal" button and the search bar.
* **Magic Meal Animation Screen Wireframe**: A dynamic screen with a spinning wheel animation to build anticipation before a recipe is revealed.
* **Magic Meal Results Screen Wireframe**: The final screen for this flow, which presents a single recipe with clear "Cook This" and "Roll Again" options.
